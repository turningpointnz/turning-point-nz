# Songs for the Charlie Kirk Vigil New Zealand

## Amazing Grace

Amazing grace! how sweet the sound,  
That saved a wretch; like me!  
I once was lost, but now am found,  
Was blind, but now I see.  

’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,  
And grace my fears relieved;  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed!  

The Lord hath promised good to me,  
His word my hope secures;  
He will my shield and portion be  
As long as life endures.  

When we’ve been there ten thousand years,  
Bright shining as the sun,  
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise  
Than when we first begun.  

## Turn your eyes upon Jesus

O soul, are you weary and troubled?  
No light in the darkness you see?  
There’s light for a look at the Savior,  
And life more abundant and free!  

*Refrain:*  
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,  
Look full in His wonderful face,  
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,  
In the light of His glory and grace.  

Through death into life everlasting  
He passed, and we follow Him there;  
O’er us sin no more hath dominion—  
For more than conqu’rors we are!  

His Word shall not fail you—He promised;  
Believe Him, and all will be well:  
Then go to a world that is dying,  
His perfect salvation to tell!  

## Goodness of God

*Verse 1*  
I love You, Lord  
Oh, Your mercy never failed me  
All my days, I've been held in Your hands  
From the moment that I wake up  
Until I lay my head  
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God  

*Chorus*  
And all my life You have been faithful  
And all my life You have been so, so good  
With every breath that I am able  
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God  

*Verse 2*  
I love Your voice  
You have led me through the fire  
And in darkest night You are close like no other  
I've known You as a Father  
I've known You as a Friend  
And I have lived in the goodness of God, yeah  

*Chorus*  
And all my life You have been faithful, ohh  
And all my life You have been so, so good  
With every breath that I am able  
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God,  

Your goodness is running after running after me  
with my life lay down i surrender now i give you everything  
your goodness is running after running after me  

## Splendour of the King

The splendor of a King, clothed in majesty  
Let all the Earth rejoice  
All the Earth rejoice  

He wraps himself in light  
And darkness tries to hide  
And trembles at His voice  
Trembles at His voice  

How great is our God, sing with me  
How great is our God, and all will see  
How great, how great is our God  

Age to age He stands  
And time is in His hands  
Beginning and the end  
Beginning and the end  

The Godhead Three in One  
Father Spirit Son  
The Lion and the Lamb  
The Lion and the Lamb  

How great is our God, sing with me  
How great is our God, and all will see  
How great, how great is our God  

Name above all names (how great is our God, sing with me)  
Worthy of our praise (how great is our God, and all will see)  
My heart will sing  
How great is our God  

You're the name above all names (how great is our God, sing with me)  
You are worthy of our praise (how great is our God, and all will see)  
And my heart will sing  
How great is our God  

How great is our God, sing with me  
How great is our God, and all will see  
How great, how great is our God  

How great is our God, sing with me  
How great is our God, and all will see  
How great, how great is our God  

How great is our God, sing with me  
How great is our God, and all will see  
How great, how great is our God  

## How Great thou art

O Lord my God  
When I in awesome wonder  
Consider all the works Thy hands have made,  
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,  
Thy pow'r throughout The universe displayed!  

*Chorus*  
Then sings my soul,  
My Savior God, to Thee;  
How great Thou art,  
How great Thou art!  
Then sings my soul,  
My Savior God, to Thee;  
How great Thou art,  
How great Thou art!  

*Verse 2*  
And when I think That God,  
His Son not sparing,  
Sent Him to die,  
I scarce can take it in  
That on the cross,  
My burden gladly bearing,  
He bled and died To take away my sin!  

*Chorus*  
Then sings my soul,  
My Savior God, to Thee;  
How great Thou art,  
How great Thou art!  
Then sings my soul,  
My Savior God, to Thee;  
How great Thou art,  
How great Thou art!  

*Verse 3*  
When Christ shall come  
With shout of acclamation  
And take me home,  
What joy shall fill my heart!  
Then I shall bow In humble adoration  
And there proclaim,  
My God, how great Thou art!  

*Chorus*  
Then sings my soul,  
My Savior God, to Thee;  
How great Thou art,  
How great Thou art!  
Then sings my soul,  
My Savior God, to Thee;  
How great Thou art,  
How great Thou art!
